# The How to GraphQL graphene back end tutorial
# (https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-python/4-authentication/) extends
# Django's user and authentication system. It's not easily possible to use
# Django's authentication system without being stuck with a user name field of
# 'username', rather than 'name' as the front-end tutorial expects. So here is
# a simple User model, just capable enough to support the tutorial, but every
# bit as na√Øve as the tutorial regarding security....
