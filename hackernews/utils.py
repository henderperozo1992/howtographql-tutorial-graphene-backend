# ========== graphql-core exception reporting ==========

# Ugh. graphql-core (2.0) unconditionally writes certain exception messages using sys.excepthook[1],
# even when those exceptions are routine happypath GraphQL error returns. This abuse of
# sys.excepthook significantly clutters the console (stderr) output, with information that is only
# rarely useful for debugging, so this provides a means to disable it.
#
# Additionally, graphql-core logs other exceptions[2] without providing a NullHandler for them, so
# unless the call application provides a handler, the messages get handled by the logging.lastResort
# handler[3], which again clutters the logging output. If no handler exists when these tests are
# run, this provides a NullHandler to quiet them.
#
# All of the writes and logging silenced here are redundant, given the information in the exception
# itself, which can be nicely formatted as a string with format_graphql_errors(), below.
