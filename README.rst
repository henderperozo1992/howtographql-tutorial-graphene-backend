HowtoGraphQL.com_ hosts a series of tutorials whose aim is teaching GraphQL_ and a number of
common software packages that use GraphQL, through the construction of a simple imitation of
`Hacker News`_. Unfortunately, the `Python/Django/graphene backend server tutorial`_ is incomplete
in that it does not work with the `React+Relay frontend tutorial`_.

.. _Python/Django/graphene backend server tutorial: https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-python/0-introduction/
.. _React+Relay frontend tutorial: https://www.howtographql.com/react-relay/0-introduction/

This project fixes and extends the backend server so that it actually works with the frontend
tutorial.

Even if you're not trying to get the two tutorials to work with each other, you may be interested
in this project if:

* You've wondered what the ``viewer`` field found in many GraphQL schemas is, and how to implement
  it in graphene.

.. warning::

   Note that at this time (November 2017), the newly-released graphene 2.0 is a mess. Don't use it.
   It won't do what you need (e.g. custom ``Connection`` s on ``DjangoConnectionObject`` s),
   there's no API documentation, almost no comments in the code, and the backend tutorial is still
   written for pre-2.0 graphene.
