# ========== Vote ==========

# There are two common GraphQL schema patterns that are difficult to implement with graphene-django
# 2.0 without distasteful monkey-patching. These are:
#
# - DjangoConnectionField can no longer be given a custom Connection, which makes it difficult to
#   add custom fields (such as the ubiquitous 'count' or 'totalCount') on the connection, and
#
# - django_filters FilterSet can't use custom Enums for OrderingFilter choices.
#
# The VoteConnection here demonstrates how to use a custom Connection, with a 'count' field and
# a non-Enum-using FilterSet, with no monkey patching.
#
# LinkConnection below demonstrates a way to use custom Enums in a custom Connection.

#
# graphene_django has some provision for generating Enums from choice-containing fields in a
# DjangoObjectType, but the Enum type name and value names are automatically generated with no way
# to control them. Furthermore, for the tutorial we need the Enum types for ordering the
# LinkConnection, and DjangoFilterConnectionType makes no provision for custom enums in FilterSets.
# So, we're back to using a custom Connection.

# ========== schema structure ==========

# A common question I've seen regarding graphene, and GraphQL back-ends in general, is "what creates
# this 'viewer' field my front-end is expecting?" Many Relay applications have GraphQL schemas that
# include a 'viewer' field, but 'viewer' is not part of the GraphQL or Relay specifications.
# Instead, it is just a common and useful pattern for introducing user authentication and/or
# grouping top-level queries. Here is a simple viewer implementation, which includes the requisite
# Relay Node and wraps our top-level queries. Note that there's no Django involved at this level,
# just graphene routing queries to the appropriate resolvers.
